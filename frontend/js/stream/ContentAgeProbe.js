/**
 * ContentAgeProbe — how old what this client shows is, image by image, on the
 * host's clock (plan framerate-hote, design §33.3).
 *
 * The per-frame end-to-end the overlay shows starts when the host captured a
 * frame. It cannot see how long the picture waited BEFORE the capture — for a
 * present the cadence gate skipped, or for the compositor of a 60 Hz display —
 * and that wait is exactly what a stream at the host's own rate is meant to
 * remove. So the content carries its own time:
 *
 *   - the bench page (scripts/bench/content/scroll.html?band=time) codes, at
 *     each of its frames, the host's steady clock in a band across the top of
 *     the screen — calibrated against the host by the bench driver over CDP,
 *     and absent until it is;
 *   - this probe reads the band out of the decoded frame (VideoFrame.copyTo of
 *     that strip alone, where reading the canvas back cost the main thread
 *     13 ms a read on an iGPU), and notes when the renderer drew that same
 *     frame (VideoRenderer.afterDraw). The copy runs in a worker
 *     (bandReadWorker.js): on the main thread it still held the frame's draw
 *     12.2 ms a read on DualRTX's AMD iGPU (03/10/2026) — every age read
 *     carried it. `readCost` in the summary is what is left of it;
 *   - the draw is put on the host's clock with an estimate made from the
 *     ping/pong, whose pong carries the host's time; the difference is the
 *     content's age when it was shown.
 *
 * The frame's own capture time (backendTs, the host's steady clock too) gives
 * the capture's age on the same estimate: it should read what the overlay's
 * end-to-end reads, which checks the clocks; content minus capture is the time
 * the picture spent on the host before the capture took it.
 *
 * ── The band ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 40 blocks, each a hundredth of the frame's width square, from the top-left
 * corner: 32 bits of the host's steady clock in units of 10 µs (least
 * significant first; it wraps every 11.9 hours), then 8 bits of check
 * (bandCheck). White is 1. The row of blocks under it holds the complement,
 * so a block the encoder smeared reads as invalid rather than as a wrong bit.
 * Sized on the width, it lands on the same blocks at any scale the stream
 * is decoded at. A band that fails any of this is counted, never guessed.
 *
 * ── What it sees ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The main-thread decode path, drawn by the Canvas2D or WebGL renderer; not
 * the decode worker, not WebGPU, not <video>. The age is taken at the end of
 * the draw: on a canvas that tears (Chromium desktop's default) the picture
 * is on screen then; on one presenting on vsync, the compositor adds up to
 * one refresh of the client that the age does not see. A frame decoded but
 * never drawn (drop-to-latest) is not an age: it is counted as `undrawn`.
 *
 * ── Drawn, and shown ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The age at the draw says how fresh each frame was when it arrived. What the
 * viewer looks at is the frame on screen at any moment, which keeps ageing
 * until the next one replaces it: 16.7 ms more at 60 frames a second, 2 ms at
 * 500. So the summary also gives the age of what is SHOWN:
 *   - `shown`, over time — every half millisecond from the first draw to the
 *     last, the frame drawn last and how old it is by then (what a canvas that
 *     tears puts on screen);
 *   - `atRefresh`, at each of this client's refreshes (requestAnimationFrame) —
 *     what a canvas presenting on vsync shows, give or take the compositor.
 * Both need every frame read (`every: 1`): a moment whose frame was not read
 * is left out. `shownSinceCapture` is `shown` counted from the frame's present
 * on the host rather than from the page's frame: what the stream adds, without
 * the page's own way to the host's screen — which varies from one launch of
 * the page to the next (5 to 22 ms on the same virtual display at 60 Hz).
