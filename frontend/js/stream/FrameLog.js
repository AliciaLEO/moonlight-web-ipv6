/**
 * FrameLog — each drawn frame's way from the host to the end of its draw, on
 * one clock (POC Ultra U0.2, docs/design/ultra-lan-poc.md §3).
 *
 * The overlay's latency is a sum of legs, each timed on its own clock and
 * averaged on its own window: a leg nobody measures (the host's wait for the
 * wire, a one-way link slower than half the ping) is missing from it. This
 * measures the whole way frame by frame instead: the frame's stamp
 * (backendTs, the host's steady clock in ms) is put on this client's clock by
 * the estimate the ping/pong makes (util/ClockEstimator.js), and taken from
 * the end of the draw.
 *
 * Where the way starts depends on the host:
 *   - the native host stamps the frame's display present, to the millisecond
 *     (NativeMediaEngine::onEncodedFrame): the whole way, read 0 to 2 ms high
 *     (both halves of the stamp are whole milliseconds);
 *   - a GameStream host's frames are counted from the arrival of the stream's
 *     FIRST frame at the backend (DataChannelRelay): its capture, encode and
 *     way to the backend are left out, the same amount on every frame.
 * The estimate is wrong by half the difference on a link slower one way than
 * the other (Wi-Fi uplink): the age reads that much off, on every frame.
 *
 * Every frame is kept, in a ring of columns (no allocation per frame), for the
 * bench to fetch over CDP: `mwFrameLog.csv()`. The main-thread path only: the
 * decode worker (opt-in) draws where this cannot see.
