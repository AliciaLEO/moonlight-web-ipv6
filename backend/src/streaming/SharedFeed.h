/**
 * @brief The guests' shared feed of this machine's native host, from the
 * server's side (plan « flux commun des invités », S5).
 *
 * The owner keeps a stream of their own, untouched. Their guests — up to three
 * — used to get one each too: a capture and an encoder per guest, all encoding
 * the same picture at the same moment, the owner's encode waiting behind theirs
 * (bench §8q: on an RTX, the owner's host total doubles with three). Here they
 * share one: a `feed` worker captures and encodes the owner's display once, and
 * each guest's worker carries its pictures to that guest's browser (the pipe:
 * FeedPublisher / FeedSubscriber).
 *
 * This class decides when that worker runs: launched by the first guest's
 * join, stopped kIdleStopMs after the last one left (a guest back sooner costs
 * nothing), relaunched under the same pipe name when it dies — its guests
 * wait for it (FeedSubscriber::kRejoinMs) — and given up after kMaxFailures
 * deaths in a row: its guests then rejoin on encoders of their own.
 *
 * Main thread only.
