// How fast the sender hands a frame's chunks to SCTP: a token bucket, for the
// bench (`pace=`; plan « Wi-Fi : la vidéo qui attend dans SCTP », W2 A).
//
// ── Why ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A frame went into the DataChannel in one go: every 16 KB chunk back to back,
// and usrsctp put it on the wire as fast as its window allowed — 40 packets of
// a 47 KB frame within a fraction of a millisecond. Wi-Fi then hands such a
// run to the client in a few aggregates, faster than the browser drains its
// UDP socket, and the client's kernel throws the overflow away. On a Mac on
// 03/10/2026, 1,855 to 2,303 datagrams a pass were dropped that way ("dropped
// due to full socket buffers"), against 3,120 to 3,960 SCTP retransmissions;
// a UDP burst into a 64 KB socket buffer lost 1.5 %, into 256 KB nothing. SCTP
// reads each drop as congestion, shrinks its window, and every later frame
// waits inside usrsctp: ~20 ms more on Wi-Fi than on Ethernet.
//
// So the chunks of a frame leave at a rate a little above the stream's own,
// and never more than a burst's worth at once: the frame still goes out within
// a fraction of its interval, but no longer as one run the client cannot hold.
//
// The bucket starts full, refills at the rate and holds at most a burst. A
// chunk waits until the bucket holds as much as the chunk, or a full burst for
// a chunk bigger than that; sending it may then take the bucket below zero,
// which the next chunk pays for. Nothing here sleeps: the sender asks how long
// to wait and does the waiting itself.
