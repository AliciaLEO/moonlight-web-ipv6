/**
 * @brief A guest worker's end of the shared feed (plan « flux commun des
 * invités », S3) — see FeedPublisher for the other one.
 *
 * Connects to the feed's pipe on a thread of its own, says hello with the
 * token its configuration line carried, and waits for the feed's `info`: the
 * session the guest joins, which the worker's launch reply is made of. From
 * then on every picture is handed to the frame callback on that same thread,
 * straight out of the read buffer — the callback sends it before it returns,
 * as the relay does with the encoder's own buffer on the owner's side — and
 * every control message after `info` comes out as controlReceived().
 *
 * A pipe that closes, or says something unreadable, is the end of this
 * subscription: disconnected() says why, once.
