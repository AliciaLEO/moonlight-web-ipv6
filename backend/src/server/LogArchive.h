/**
 * The "Download logs" archive (admin page → Advanced): what someone attaches
 * to an email or an issue so the problem they just had can be read.
 *
 * Only the latest non-empty file of each kind — the server's log, the last
 * stream worker's, the browsers', the probe's... — never the whole directory:
 * a busy host keeps a week of them, and what explains a problem is what was
 * written last. An about.txt says which build and which system wrote them.
 *
 * Built on a thread of its own (the HTTP server is single-threaded, and a
 * large worker log takes a moment to deflate), polled for its progress, then
 * handed over whole. One archive at a time; the last one stays until the next.
