/**
 * What the "Download logs" archive does to every file before it goes in: the
 * archive is made to be attached to a public GitHub issue, and a log written
 * for its owner holds what nobody else should read.
 *
 * Hidden, as "(hidden)": what grants access or decrypts — PINs, passwords,
 * tokens, keys (rikey, pairing secrets, ICE credentials, the tunnel's host
 * key), cookies and Authorization headers, PEM blocks, the client's unique id,
 * the rendezvous and share links, and what a person typed or looked at
 * (keyboard diagnostics, window titles, geolocation, e-mail and MAC addresses).
 *
 * Replaced, the same value by the same stand-in across the whole archive so a
 * reader can still follow one machine or one address from line to line, each
 * in braces — a label, not part of the address:
 *   - machines by capital letters: {A} is always this PC, the hosts and the
 *     other machines named in the log {B}, {C}... in order of appearance. A
 *     machine's names (Names, and LAN names such as "Kids-iPad.local") and
 *     its LAN addresses get the same letter: "{B} is online (192.168.x.{B})".
 *     A second address of one machine under the same prefix is {A2};
 *   - LAN addresses of no known machine (private ranges, CGNAT/Tailscale,
 *     link-local, ULA) by a small letter for their /24 (/64 in IPv6) and a
 *     number for the address in it: 192.168.x.{a1}, 10.x.x.{b2}, 100.x.x.{c1},
 *     fd::{d1}, fe80::{e1}; .0 and .255 keep their number ({a0}, {a255});
 *   - public addresses by a number under a prefix no address has:
 *     256.x.x.{1}, 2xxx::{1}. Never a machine's letter: machines behind one
 *     router share its public address;
 *   - the instance's name and the OS account by instance-name and user, the
 *     account in home paths (C:\Users\<name>, /home/<name>, /Users/<name>)
 *     too, and the instance's own moonlightweb.top subdomain by instance.
 * Loopback, multicast and 0.0.0.0 stay: they are the same on every machine.
 *
 * A best effort over free text, not a guarantee: it knows the formats
 * MoonlightWeb writes, and the names it is told.
