/// A game device's HID report descriptor, rebuilt from what WebHID shows a page.
///
/// ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The HID passthrough (docs/design/hid-passthrough-study.md) recreates on the
/// host the device plugged into the client: same VID/PID, same name, same
/// reports. The browser never hands the page the device's report descriptor,
/// only a tree of `collections` describing it (§2.2 of the study). So the host
/// writes a descriptor back from that tree, one that lays out every report bit
/// for bit as the real one does. The encoding differs (Push/Pop, delimiters,
/// string indexes are gone); what a parser makes of it does not.
///
/// Three pieces, all pure, so mw-native-tests checks them with no device:
///  - encode(): collections → descriptor bytes;
///  - parse(): descriptor bytes → the fields a host parser sees, each with its
///    report, bit offset, size, usages and bounds;
///  - validate(): what the host accepts to create from network data (§5.5):
///    game usages only, bounded sizes.
///
/// "Equivalent" is checked by parsing both descriptors and comparing
/// normalise()d fields: a variable item split into its elements, a usage range
/// spelled out, physical bounds that default to the logical ones filled in.
/// That is the comparison the tests make against real descriptors, and the one
/// the H2 bench makes against the device's own.
