/// On one GPU a CRTC scans out a window of the root, so its (x, y) is its place
/// on the desktop — but only the CRTCs of the GPU X renders on. A monitor on a
/// second GPU (a PRIME output sink: X copies its part of the root into a buffer
/// of that GPU) scans out from (0, 0) of that copy, and nothing in KMS says
/// where the copy came from. The union of one card's outputs is not the
/// desktop either: X stretches an absolute device over its whole root, every
/// GPU's monitors included. Measured on the UM790Pro (30/09/2026, X11, the
/// M27Q on a GTX 1050 at 0,0 and the Radeon's screen at 2560,0): the centre of
/// the Radeon's picture put the pointer at 2241,720 of the 4480×1440 root.
///
/// ── Recognised by what the driver read, not by its name ────────────────────
///
/// X drivers name outputs their own way — the amdgpu driver counts from 0
/// ("HDMI-A-0" is the kernel's HDMI-A-1, and its "HDMI-A-1" is another
/// connector), modesetting from 1 ("HDMI-1"), and both add the GPU for an
/// output sink ("HDMI-A-1-0"). A name matched across them lands on the next
/// connector. What they share is what they read from the kernel: the EDID
/// blob, byte for byte, and — amdgpu and modesetting both publish it — the
/// connector's id. So, in that order: the one output with the same EDID;
/// among several (two monitors of one model), the one with the same connector
/// id; and failing both, the one at the CRTC's own rectangle, which is right on
/// the GPU X renders on and the last resort only. Ambiguity is no answer: the
/// caller then keeps what KMS said.
///
/// Pure, in the header, like pickWaylandRects: every platform's run tests it.
