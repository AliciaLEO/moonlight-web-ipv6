/// Force feedback for a recreated wheel (plan "Passthrough HID", P3/P4).
///
/// ── Why a PID block ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// A game asks DirectInput for force feedback, and Windows gives it through
/// pid.dll to any HID device whose descriptor carries the USB PID 1.0 usages
/// (page 0x0F). Real wheels that speak PID (Moza, Simucube…) carry that block
/// themselves; the G923 does not — Logitech drives its motor through HID++
/// feature 0x8123 instead. So the host gives the recreated wheel a PID block of
/// its own, decodes what pid.dll writes into neutral operations (an effect and
/// its parameters, start, stop, gain) and the page plays them on the real wheel
/// through whatever that wheel speaks (frontend/js/hid/hidppFfb.js for 0x8123).
/// No DLL of ours registers anywhere.
///
/// pid.dll also asks synchronous questions (GET_FEATURE): which effect block a
/// new effect got, how big the pool is. Those are answered here, at once, from
/// the host's own table: a round trip to the page would hold the game's
/// CreateEffect for a network round trip, and over the Internet that is tens of
/// milliseconds per effect.
///
/// Linux is out of scope: hid-pidff only binds to usbhid devices, never uhid.

constexpr int kPidReports = 14;
/// Effect blocks the host hands out (indexes 1..kPidMaxEffects).

/// The first report id free for the block after the device's own, or 0 when
/// none fits: a device without report ids (the TX12) cannot take one, as ids
/// must be all zero or all non-zero.

/// Simucube, Fanatec, Thrustmaster… carry one). The recreated device must not
/// show it: two blocks would confuse pid.dll, and the device's would talk to
/// a motor the host cannot reach. With force feedback, the host's block takes
/// its place and the page re-encodes what it says into the device's own PID
/// reports (frontend/js/hid/pidFfb.js).
///
/// Every item inside a PID collection, or with a PID usage, becomes padding
/// of the same size, so a report the device shares with its own fields keeps
/// its layout; reports left with padding alone, and collections left empty,
/// are dropped. Call pidFirstId() before, on the device's collections as they
/// came: the block's ids must stay clear of the reports the device still sends.
