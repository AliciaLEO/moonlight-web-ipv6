// The pixel proof of the Vulkan Video encoder (plan pipeline-video-d3d12-v2,
// C13.5; Bruno, 28/09/2026: a firmware or a driver that does not encode
// reliably in Vulkan gets VA-API, on its own).
//
// ── Why pixels ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// On the 780M, headers read back said everything right — the QP asked, the
// reference set asked — and the stream was wrong from its first P picture:
// the SPS said one transform depth, AMD's firmware coded another (bench
// §8o.3). Neither the firmware's number nor Mesa's version said "reliable":
// only a decoder that reads the stream as a browser would.
//
// ── What it does ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A short sequence that moves (the lab's pictures, the ones that caught the
// fault), through the product's own encoder — the same parameter sets, the
// same rate control, at the stream's size — with a loss healed by a delta
// and a keyframe asked for on the way; decoded by Vulkan Video on the same
// GPU; compared picture by picture and CTB row by CTB row. A stream that
// decodes to what went in is trusted; any other outcome, and a proof that
// cannot run at all (no decoder, a device lost), is a refusal with its
// reason, and the session encodes through VA-API.
//
// ── Once ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A proof is a few hundred milliseconds. Its verdict is kept in the user's
// cache under what could change it — the GPU, its driver, the kernel, the
// VCN firmware on AMD, the size, and this engine's own encoder revision — so
// that a session opens without it the next time. Only a comparison is kept:
// a proof that could not run is asked again.
