/// Our own rate control (plan pipeline-video-d3d12-v2, §4.6): a QP for every
/// picture, handed to an encoder told a constant QP.
///
/// ── Why one of our own ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// D3D12 Video Encode on the Arc takes its bitrate once, when the encoder is
/// made: the governor, the frame-rate scaling and the still-screen boost all
/// move the target through setBitrate(), and the driver refused every one of
/// those moves — a still screen stayed at the first bitrate's ~33 KB a pass
/// and never sharpened (27/09/2026, bench §8n.5). The delta-QP map that would
/// have carried a controller of ours is refused at EncodeFrame by the
/// runtime's second look (plan §4.6). What the Arc does do is code each
/// picture at a constant QP changed since the last one, without being told,
/// and say which QP it used: that is the lever, and this is what moves it.
/// Anywhere else it runs as a witness only (the bench's rc12=qp).
///
/// ── The model, and why its slope is learned ─────────────────────────────────
///
/// Around the QP it was last coded at, a picture's size falls by half for
/// every k of QP: log2(bits) = level − (QP − anchor) / k. The textbook k is
/// 6 — the quantizer's step doubles — and it holds for a game: the Call of
/// Duty clip on the bench held its rate to a few percent with it. It does not
/// hold for a page of text scrolling: on the Arc, 162 KB at QP 24 and next to
/// nothing at QP 36 (27/09/2026) — the residual of an edge that moved either
/// clears the quantizer or does not. There k is nearer 2, and a model that
/// believes 6 swings between pictures four times their budget and empty ones.
/// So k is read off the pictures: two new pictures whose QPs differ by two or
/// more, and whose sizes moved the other way, give a secant; the slope moves
/// a third of the way to it, between 1.5 and 9. A picture coded again for an
/// overshoot gives the cleanest secant there is: the same picture at two QPs.
///
/// The level is anchored at the last new picture's QP and moved there after
/// each one, so the model never reaches far from where it was measured. It
/// is smoothed, half the old and half the new, so that one noisy picture moves
/// the QP by a step or two; two pictures in a row it missed the same way by
/// more than twice — a new scene, a window opened — replace it outright. One
/// alone does not: at 120 fps a scroll captured with two presents folded
/// costs 2.5 times the next, and a model replaced by each in turn codes each
/// at the QP the other needed. A picture of a few hundred bytes
/// says little: at a QP above what the content needs, P pictures are skipped
/// nearly whole and cost the same whatever the QP. It may lower the level by
/// half at most, and teaches no slope.
///
/// ── The budget ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// A bucket, the VBV's: every picture pours its bits in, the link takes a
/// frame's worth (bitrate / fps) out before the next one, and it never holds
/// less than nothing — a link left idle is capacity gone, not saved. What is
/// in it is time the next picture waits behind on the wire. So a predicted
/// picture's budget is a frame's worth less half of what is in the bucket (a
/// backlog is paid back in halves), and an intra picture's is the VBV itself,
/// by the rule every encoder follows (RateControl.h). Never below an eighth of
/// a frame's worth: there the QP is at the top of its range anyway.
///
/// ── Up at once, down in steps ──────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// Latency first. A picture over its budget delays every picture behind it
/// and one under it delays nothing, so the two errors are not worth the same:
/// the QP rises as far as the model says at once, and falls by 3 at most per
/// new picture when pictures got cheaper — a menu over a game, a camera at
/// rest — because the next one may well cost what they used to. The brake is
/// on what the model believes, not on the QP: a budget that grows (the
/// governor, a backlog paid back) is known exactly and is followed on the
/// next picture, through the slope learned. One exception: a picture that
/// jumped far above the others, followed by one back where they were, was a
/// one-off — a cut, a flash, a page wrapping round — and the belief from
/// before it comes back whole, without the brake.
///
/// ── The same picture again ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The still-screen passes and the idle floor encode the picture that already
/// went out, and every pass codes what the one before it left out: between the
/// picture's quantizer and its own, (2^((QP before − QP) / 6) − 1) of the
/// whole picture at the QP it has — the whole picture costs the same in the
/// end, however many passes it takes. So a pass is priced against that whole
/// picture, not as a picture of its own: priced as one, a page of text whose
/// first picture was three times its budget got no pass below that picture's
/// QP, and the burst ended there, "converged", at QP 42 (27/09/2026). Passes
/// keep that whole picture's complexity apart, started from the picture's own
/// and read again off every pass that refined, and it never moves the model
/// new pictures are sized by — the first movement after a sharpened desktop
/// is budgeted as movement, not as the nothing the last pass cost. A pass goes
/// down 6 at most (the step halves) and never above the QP the picture already
/// has: coded there, the residual is under the quantizer and the pass costs
/// next to nothing, which is what an idle-floor frame should cost. A light
/// picture reaches 18 in three to five passes; a heavy one at a low bitrate
/// reaches what RefineConvergence's cap of passes buys, and the idle floor
/// carries on from there.
///
/// ── What it does not do ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// It sees whole pictures: a picture far over its budget has gone out before
/// anything can be done about it. reencode() gives the QP that would have
/// fitted, for an encoder that can afford to code the picture again (the
/// bench's reencode=, a decision the bench's numbers wait on — plan §9-5).
