/// cadence=deadline (plan framerate-hote §13, Bruno's idea): one frame per
/// refresh of the client's screen, the freshest that can still make it.
///
/// ── Why ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// A screen shows a new picture once per refresh. A host whose display runs
/// faster than the client's — a virtual display at 240 or 500 Hz — has
/// several pictures to offer per client refresh, and only one of them can be
/// shown. Sending all of them (cadence=host) lets the client take the
/// freshest, at the price of decoding every one; sending on a grid of its own
/// (today's gate) decodes one each, but lands it anywhere in the refresh and
/// wastes half of one on average. Aimed at the refresh, one frame is enough.
///
/// ── The grid ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The client (frontend VsyncGrid.js) sends, every 500 ms, its refresh period,
/// one refresh on this host's steady clock, and its lead: how long a frame
/// takes from being taken here to being ready there (drawn when its canvas
/// tears, decoded on vsync), with a margin it widens on every miss. For the
/// refresh R, the picture must be taken at R − lead: whatever the display
/// last presented by then is the freshest that can make it, and taking it
/// later could not. The loop sleeps until that instant, takes what is there,
/// and encodes it at once; nothing new, nothing sent.
///
/// The lead is counted from the moment the picture is TAKEN, not from its
/// own present, and the frames aimed this way carry that moment as their
/// capture time: a game at 60 fps on a 240 Hz display leaves its last present
/// up to 16 ms behind the instant, and a lead that counted it would move
/// every instant earlier for nothing.
///
/// ── Staleness ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// A grid not heard for kStaleUs is dropped and the loop goes back to the
/// cadence it had; so is one that makes no sense (a period outside 10 to
/// 500 Hz, a lead of more than half a second, a refresh far from now).
///
/// Pure and clocked by the caller; note() from the thread that reads the
/// control channel, the rest from the capture loop.
