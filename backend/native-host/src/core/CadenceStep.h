/// ── Why the stream may go faster than the client's screen ──────────────────
///
/// "Auto" streams at the client's refresh rate, and the gate (FrameCadence)
/// encodes the first present of each interval. When the content changes faster
/// than that — a page scrolling at 240 Hz on the virtual display, a game at 80
/// frames a second for a 60 Hz client — what a skipped present showed waits
/// for the next admitted one. A client that tears paints every frame the moment
/// it is decoded, so a faster stream shows it younger pictures: 3 to 6 ms on
/// the bench, where the client keeps up (framerate-hote §12). Where it does not
/// — a weak decoder, Wi-Fi — the faster stream queues and costs far more than
/// it gains. Only the client can tell which, by measuring; so the client asks,
/// and the host answers at once and applies the answer between two frames.
///
/// ── What the host decides ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// - Nothing above the captured display's refresh: Desktop Duplication has no
///   frames beyond it. A step above is capped there; a display no faster than
///   the stream leaves nothing to step to.
/// - Nothing its encoder cannot hold: a step is refused when the encoder's p95
///   over its last window is longer than one frame at that rate.
/// - Nothing under a bench cadence (EncoderTuning::Cadence), which owns the
///   rate, nor for a client whose decoder asked for fewer frames
///   (`clientfpscap`) or that paints on its vsync — one frame per refresh, and
///   none of the rest would ever be seen.
/// - The bitrate does not move: the encoder's per-frame budget follows the
///   rate through EffectiveCadence::retarget, the same road a client screen
///   that changed takes, so the wire carries the setting's bitrate in smaller
///   frames.
///
/// Pure, so the answer and its reasons are testable without a display.
