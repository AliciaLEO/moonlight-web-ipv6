/// The D3D12 chain (plan pipeline-video-d3d12-v2, §3.1). One picture, one
/// thread, no queue of frames:
///
///  1. the capture's D3D11 context signals fence A right after the acquire;
///  2. the conversion queue waits for it on the GPU, converts the surface
///     opened in D3D12 into the encoder's input, and signals fence B and the
///     pipeline's own fence;
///  3. the capture context waits for fence B on the GPU before ReleaseFrame,
///     so the compositor cannot write the surface under the read;
///  4. the encoder waits for the pipeline's fence on its own queue, and the
///     CPU waits for the bitstream — the frame's only CPU wait.
///
/// Anything that goes wrong once a session is streaming — a device removed,
/// a fence past its deadline, an encoder error, the header guard — makes
/// encode() answer Lost, and the session goes back to D3D11 for good. A
/// conversion that fails is kept for that answer rather than returned: the
/// session ends on a failed conversion, and D3D12 must never end a session
/// D3D11 could have carried.
///
/// MW_D3D12_FAULT makes each of those happen on demand, at a picture chosen
/// (D3d12Fault, plan C8.1): the way back to D3D11 is watched on the bench
/// rather than trusted.

/// one: at most two in flight, never a queue. D3D12 Video Encode only: the
