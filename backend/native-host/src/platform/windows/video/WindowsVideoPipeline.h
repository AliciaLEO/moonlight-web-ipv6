/// The session owns what is the same whichever way a picture is encoded: the
/// capture, the loop and its cadence, the rate governor, the still-screen
/// boost and the load cap. What differs is how a picture becomes a bitstream,
/// and that is all this interface is. The D3D11 path came first and was moved
/// behind it without a change of behaviour — same calls, same order, same log
/// lines — so that a second pipeline could be written beside it rather than
/// threaded through the session.
///
/// ── Lifetime ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// open() once per session, before the first build: whatever survives capture
/// restarts (the bridge's device). Then, on every (re)build — session start, a
/// capture that came back on a new device, the load cap — teardown(),
/// raisePriority(), buildConverter() and buildEncoder(), in that order; the
/// session speaks between the last two (tone map, SDR white), which is why the
/// build comes in two halves. close() at stop().
