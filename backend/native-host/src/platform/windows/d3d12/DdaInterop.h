///
/// Desktop Duplication duplicates onto a D3D11 device, and there is no D3D12
/// equivalent. Its surface is shareable, so D3D12 can open it through an NT
/// handle and read the same VRAM. But the keyed mutex that stands between the
/// surface and the compositor orders the D3D11 context only: a D3D12 read
/// submitted right after AcquireNextFrame may run before the compositor's
/// write has landed, and one still running after ReleaseFrame may see the next
/// frame half written. Two fences shared between the APIs order both edges,
/// on the GPU:
///
///   A  D3D11 → D3D12  the capture context signals after the acquire; the
///                     conversion queue waits for it before reading;
///   B  D3D12 → D3D11  the conversion queue signals once it has read; the
///                     capture context waits for it before ReleaseFrame, so the
///                     keyed mutex is let go after the read — and the CPU does
///                     not wait at all.
///
/// ── Rebinding ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// A capture restart brings a new D3D11 device: both fences are made again
/// and the opened surfaces forgotten. The D3D12 device and its queues stay.

/// D3D11 is only useful if it says which step said no.
